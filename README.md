# Todo App Project

![Desktop Preview](/desktop/desktop-preview.jpg)

This project encompasses a Todo application developed using React, Redux Toolkit, and Styled Components. The project aims to provide dynamic solutions while maintaining a clean and optimized codebase.

## Features

- **Themes:** The project offers users two theme options, light and dark. It is responsive to browser themes, automatically selecting the light or dark theme based on your browser's default theme.

- **Drag and Drop Sorting:** A custom sorting logic has been developed to enable users to reorder Todo tasks using the drag-and-drop method. No external libraries have been used for this purpose.

- **Text Display:** In case of text overflow for Todo tasks, it is possible to view the full text by clicking on the text. This feature prevents layout distortion and provides a more readable list.

- **Responsive Design:** The project is designed to be compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, offering a user-friendly experience on each platform.
